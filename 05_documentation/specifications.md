# Specifications

## Objective

Create an underwater propulsion system that can be mounted on each of the user's arms.

## Technical Specifications (WIP)

Initial target specifications for the hydro propulsor:

- **Portability**: Lightweight and compact, suitable for solo use and easy transport
- **Buoyancy**: The device should be neutrally buoyant (density equal to water)
- **Thrust**: Minimum of 30 Newtons per arm, with a target of 50 Newtons for optimal performance
- **Water Resistance**: Operational at depths up to 5 meters
- **Autonomy**: At least 30 minutes of continuous operation under typical use conditions

## Software Requirements

All software used in this project must be 100% free and open-source.

## Note
These specifications represent an initial vision of the system's capabilities.  
They are highly interdependent (e.g., power vs. autonomy) and will be revised iteratively after the ideation phase and before each new development milestone.
