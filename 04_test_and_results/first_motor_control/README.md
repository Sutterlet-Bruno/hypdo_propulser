# First Control of Brushless 4-Pole DC Motor

## Purpose

This project is a prototype of a Brushless Motor Controller. The purpose of this prototype has two main motivations: **personal learning** and **advancement of the Hydrojet project**.

The goal of this prototype is to create an initial architecture for motor control that can be easily updated and adapted to other motors. This will be achieved using a low-cost microcontroller (MCU) as a proof of concept. No PCB will be designed at this stage.

### Project Objectives

- Create an initial firmware for motor control
- Design an initial architecture for motor control using a microcontroller
- Identify the limitations of this type of control method (RPM vs magnetic RPM, torque, power, noise, size, cost, etc.)

### Personal Objectives

- Refresh skills with KiCad
- Build a professional-quality electrical project from scratch
