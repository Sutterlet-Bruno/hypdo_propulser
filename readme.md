# Hydro Propulsor Project

## General Description and Context

This project aims to create a portable, affordable, and user-friendly hydro propulsor.  
It is a solo, free-time project developed as a learning experience to improve my skills in:

- Motor control
- Mechanical design
- Technical documentation
- Project management

Every part of the project will be made available in this repository.  
I'll keep improving its usability and documentation as the project evolves.
The objective is to only use free software for every parts of the project to make it more afordable.

## Project Structure
Here is the current structure of the project folder. 

- `00_technical_sheets/`: Component datasheets and technical references
- `01_mechanical_design/`: CAD files and 3D models
- `02_electronics/`: Circuit diagrams and PCB layouts
- `03_software/`: Firmware and control code (e.g., Arduino)
- `04_tests_and_results/`: Test reports, measurements, photos, videos
- `05_documentation/`: Generated documentation and user guides
- `assets/`: Visual elements used in the README and documentation

## Technical Specifications (WIP)

Initial target specifications for the hydro propulsor:

- Portability: Lightweight and compact design, suitable for transport and solo use
- Weight: The device's density should match that of water (neutral buoyancy)
- Thrust: Minimum of 30 Newtons per arm, with a target of 50N for optimal performance
- Water resistance: Operational at depths up to 5 meters
- Autonomy: At least 30 minutes of continuous operation under standard usage

These specifications represent an initial vision of the product's capabilities.
They are highly interdependent (e.g., power vs. autonomy) and will be reviewed after the ideation phase and before each new development stage.
